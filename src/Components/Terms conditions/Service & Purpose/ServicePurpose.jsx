        Momeals is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing food waste
        and addressing hunger problems in India, particularly focusing on
        providing nutritional assistance to malnourished children. Our services
        include a web-app platform where individuals and establishments can
        submit pickup requests to give away leftover food or edible items. We
        also engage in field strategies, visiting restaurants, hotels, and
        events to encourage food donation instead of disposal. Furthermore, we
        accept online donations and maintain transparent records of all
        contributions.
